Milestone Project 2 (Jackie Summerfield Ceramics Online Shop)


Initiation -

For the Interactive Front End Development Milestone Project (project 2), I have 
decided to create additional services to http://jsummerfieldceramics.co.uk/ website. 
This website was a paid development job for a client that I also used for the User 
Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project (project 1). I have talked with the 
client and she is happy for me to develop the site further to include an e-commerce 
feature in the form of an online shop.



Kickstarter Meeting -

After talking with Jackie, we decided on a few main points:

It would be a seperate website that links to her official website, as her main 
website is to showcase her portfolio..It would maintain the same style and layout 
as the main website for consistency. The shop would include new items available to buy.

Thoughts after the meeting:

The fact that she wanted the e-commerce site to be seperate will keep the project 
separate from the old website code, this will be easier for the assessor to see 
what is new code and what is old. Keeping the same styles and layout will save 
a lot of time in the front end stages of the development, so I can focus on the 
User Centric coding and the inner workings of the new site. Jackie has all the 
item images ready for me to format which will save time.



Main Technology Requirements for Project - 

Required: 

HTML 
CSS 
JavaScript.

As I am using the styles and markdown from the previous project, I will be 
incorporating these three mandatory requirements. The Main layout will be the 
same using the Bootstrap library for styling and Javascript for single page navigation. 
I think that re-using this code shows an understanding of a programmers core 
principle ‘D.R.Y.’, (Don't repeat yourself) this is a process of software development 
aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns. In Code Institute we are taught that 
this is the way of the developer and I think the code I have already written from scratch 
will suffice in covering these three main technologies in full. In the new project I will 
commit the code with version control from scratch to show my competence in these fields 
but the styles and core layout will remain the same as the last project.

Optional: 

jQuery
D3.js
crossfilter and/or dc.js
any other JavaScript libraries
SaSS
external APIs.

I intend to use an external API for the online shop. This is something I need to 
discuss with my mentor for advice. I want to add a contact form too, an additional 
API. I have also become skilled in jQuery using a course on Codecademy so I will 
use this Javascript library to add extra user interaction (animations etc). l  
For now I think the use of two APIs and jQuery will suffice for this project.



Plan -

Initial UX/UI Development -

Having all the research from the previous project allows me to skip past the main 
layout and style component decisions and onto the core features for a single page 
online shop. I can use the old layout designs for consistency. The old UI/UX development 
documentation will be attached as Project-1-old-development-ui-ux.pdf if it is needed by examiners. 



First Meeting with Mentor -  

I had a productive talk with my mentor Anna Villanueva, I told her my plan to develop 
my old live project and add an e-commerce page. She said “this is great because you 
are expanding a current project you already have and the fact that your client will 
be using it will be awesome too”. 

I had done some searching for an e-commerce API and found www.snipcart.com, this 
site had all the features I would need and the CSS is customizable. She agreed with 
me that this would be a good API to use.

After this first meeting I felt more confident to continue with the project. Initially 
I was concerned about if I could continue with an old project or if I had to start 
a new one from scratch. Thankfully my mentor cleared this up for me and I feel better 
with my direction.  



Wireframe Sketches - 

I have decided to use a similar user interface to the gallery pages on the website. 
This will keep the consistency in the overall site and speed up the development. 
I will reuse my HTML and CSS. Find these in the wireframes folder.



Project Documentation -

Project Version Control Documentation:

I have decided to give a running commentary of my version control with GitHub. 
This will give even further clarity to my development process. Using the layout 
from the portraits.html file from the first milestone project I have been able to 
reuse some HTML and CSS code to speed up the development process, I have committed 
it to GitHub in sections to show my competence with version control. Here is some 
added annotation to each commit.

Initial Commit:

I have reused all the links from portraits.html and pasted them into the shop page

Commit Two:

I Took the main nav bar elements from the website and pasted them in so it is the 
same as the rest of the site.

Commit Three:

I added all the styles From the website.

Commit Four:

Added the Bootstrap Javascript that enables the menu toggle button to function.

Commit Five:

I repurposed the layout from portraits.html for use as an online shop.

Commit Six:

Added the footer.

Commit Seven:

HTML and CSS finished, user interface ready for e-commerce API setup.

Commit Eight:

Added all product images and allowed lightbox functionality.

Commit Nine:

Added e-commerce API script.

Commit Ten:

validate API with Key.

Commit Eleven:

Added Buy button linked to external API.

Commit Twelve:

Added new styles to API to align with page styles.

Commit Thirteen:

I have decided to add the shop page to the rest of the site to show both the shop 
API and the contact form API.

Commit Fourteen: 

Added a contact form using HTML and CSS.

Commit Fifteen:

Added The JS for the contact from functionality. I used EmailJS and followed the 
tutorials supplied by Code Institute. 



Final Words for examiner -

Just to clarify, I have only worked on the shop.html and the e-commerce API it 
contains, and the contact form API in contact.html. All other code I completed 
for the first milestone project.
